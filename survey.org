* Survey analysis
** Notes
- only 50 odd answers, many of them either didn't use the DF or don't need it
- hard to determine priorities which features are most
- next time we should have more 'freestyle' fields, and less multiple-choice questions. Just not enough participants for that data to be useful.

** Observations
- sharing usually within groups of less than 10 people
- nobody seems to need metadata (one person mentions metadata, but only in regards to research data provenance)

** Requested features (in perceived order of importance)
- sharing
- desktop sync
- better, faster interface(s)
- accessible from compute cluster(s)
- static, long-term storage (without the hassles/cost)
- large volume storage
